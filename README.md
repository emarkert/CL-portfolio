# CL-portfolio

## Description
```
This is a simple portfolio layout that will hopefully grow with new projects that I tackle for independent learning as well as new projects that I work at in my new career. 

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. .portrait
    This class changes the portrait image on index so that it is a circle and fits well in the col

2. h1, h2::after 
    These classes add the aquamarine background on headers for the color pop on the page. 

3. .my-name
    Adds a better font-weight to the headline. 

```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created 

1. JQuery function that has an array of "titles" that are rotated and appended to the span "rotate" on index.html
